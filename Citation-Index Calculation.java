 * Citation-Index Calculation

Problem Statement
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a program to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
Input
Input contains a single integer denoting the size of array.
The next line contains an array of integers, i.e., an array of citations

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^3
1 <= A[i] <= 10^3
Output
Output a single integer denoting the h-index.
Example
Input:
5
3 0 6 1 5

Output:
3

Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
